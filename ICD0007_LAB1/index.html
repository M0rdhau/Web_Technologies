    <h1>Save the bees</h1>
    <p>According to all known laws
      of aviation,
      <em>there is no way</em> a bee
      should be able to fly.
      Its wings are <em>too small</em> to get
      its fat little body off the ground.
      The bee, of course, flies anyway
      <strong>
        because bees don&#39;t care
      what humans think is impossible.
      </strong></p>
